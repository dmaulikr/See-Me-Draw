I wrote this app for my teenage son who has profound learning difficulties and no speech, to entertain him and help with his development. The app is a drawing game, based on dot-to-dot. When you touch one of the red dots the app will draw a line to where your finger moves, until you touch an adjacent dot in the picture. The app will join the two dots together. Until you finish the picture a green dot moves between the next two dots to join, as a hint.

When all the dots have been joined they will fade away and the picture that the dots represent will appear.

The app is written in Objective-C, for the iPad. It is available in the iTunes store @ https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/ian-ellis/id754782887
